## CS 350 Module Eight Journal Reflection

### Project Summaries

#### Smart Thermostat Prototype (7-1 Project Submission)
**Objective:** Develop a prototype for a smart thermostat using the TI board, integrating features like temperature reading, LED output indicators, set temperature adjustment, and simulated server data transmission.

**Problem Solved:** The project aimed to create a foundational prototype for a smart thermostat, capable of interfacing with SysTec's server software over Wi-Fi, addressing a growing market need.

#### LED Control via State Machine (3-2 Milestone Two Submission)
**Objective:** Program the TI CC3220x LAUNCHXL to control an LED through the serial port using a state machine, with the goal of turning the LED on and off based on user input.

**Problem Solved:** This lab focused on practical application of UART and GPIO drivers in embedded systems, enabling control of hardware components (LED) through software instructions.

### Reflections
